Try to make some observations with gaps of 2-14 hours

Here's a plan:
* when it's not twilight, and haven't observed the start in the night, can draw a gap of between 2hours to (end of night-block time). Make a healpix map of things visible now, and visible at second time. Maybe even approximate the 5-sigma depth in the future. Generate a blob-pair, then add the long gap to the scheduled observations for later.

make a wrapper survey object, that holds some blob survey(s), and if the blob returns something, then make it scheduled for later too.
