Try to create a new ToO simulation.

Using https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04051.pdf as a point of figuring out a strategy.

Expect localizations on the order of 20-200 sq degrees, so 4 to 20 pointings needed to cover area. 

They want log-spacing of the observations at 1, 2, 4, 8 hours after merger.

They don't realize the filter wheel only holds 5 filters.

Maybe we can make a survey object that looks for new events, then generates scripted observations for each event. Give it a footprint that the center of the event has to be in.
