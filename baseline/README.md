Updates from previous baseline(s):

* Using script filename to automatically name output database
* Demand u-band always be taken as 1 snap (both blob survey and DDFs)
* Ideal pair time increased from 22 minutes to 33 minutes (outside of twiligt)
* take pairs in twilight time (mixed filters, ideally spaced 15 minutes)
* new footprint
* increased weight on footprint, resulting in higher survey uniformity and some higher airmass observations
* a half-sky rolling cadence scheme is used
